We really appreciate and value contributions to Graph Uncrashable. Please review the items listed below to make sure that your contributions are merged as soon as possible :pray:

## Contribution Guidelines

### Creating Pull Requests (PRs)

As a contributor, you are expected to fork this repository, work on your own fork and then submit pull requests. The pull requests will be reviewed and approved before merged into the 'dev' branch and subsequently the 'main' branch of the repo. 

Typical workflow for adding a contribution(s):

1. Make sure your fork reflects the latest version and is up to date with the 'main' repository

`cd /Users/<USERNAME>/Documents/float-subgraph-uncrashable`
`git pull`

Note: The directory `float-subgraph-uncrashable` represents your fork's local copy.

2. Create a working branch from the master branch into 'fix/some-bug-#15'

Postfixing '#15' will associate your PR with the issue '#15' and make everyone's life easier.

`git checkout -b fix/some-bug-#15`

3. Make your changes, add your files, commit, and push to your fork

`git add SomeFile.js`
`git commit -m "This change fixes bug '#15'`
`git push origin fix/some-bug-#15`

4. Go to github.com/float-capital/float-subgraph-uncrashable in your web browser and issue a new pull request

Read the PR template very carefully and make sure to follow all the instructions. These instructions refer to some very important conditions that your PR must meet in order to be accepted, such as making sure that all tests pass, etc.

5. Your code will be reviwed by maintainers. Maintainers check that all tests pass, review the coding style, and check for general code correctness. If everything is OK, we'll merge your pull request and your code will be part of Graph Uncrashable
